### Prosper Loan Dataset EDA with R

#### Overview
The dataset investigated in this project is from Prosper. Prosper is the market leader in peer-to-peer lending (a popular alternative to traditional loans and investing options).

It works in the following way:

- **Borrowers** choose loan amount, purpose and post a loan listing.
- **Investors** review loan listings and invest in listings they are interested in.
- Once the process is complete, borrowers make fixed monthly payments and investors receive a portion of those payments directly to their Prosper account.

This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, borrower employment status, borrower credit history, and the latest payment information.

#### What is EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the numerical and graphical examination of data characteristics and relationships before formal, rigorous statistical analyses are applied.

EDA can lead to insights, which may uncover to other questions, and eventually predictive models. It also is an important “line of defense” against bad data and is an opportunity to notice that your assumptions or intuitions about a data set are violated.

#### Analysis Process Overview
In this project, we will use R and apply EDA(exploratory data analysis) techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

The methodology is through univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis to explore this dataset. The tool we will be using is R’s visualization package ggplot2 and linear model.
