### Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

In this project, we will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect).

**Background information** 

In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition. checkout this [page](https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/words.html#seffect)

#### Questions for investigation

* Q1. What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable?

* Q2. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform?

* Q3. Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset.

* Q4. Provide one or two visualizations that show the distribution of the sample data. Write one or two sentences noting what you observe about the plot or plots.

* Q5.  What is your confidence level and your critical statistic value? Do you reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it? Come to a conclusion in terms of the experiment task. Did the results match up with your expectations?


* Q6. Hypotheses regarding the reasons for the effect observed are presented. An extension or related experiment to the performed Stroop task is provided, that may produce similar effects.
